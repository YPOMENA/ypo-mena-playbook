CHAPTER CHAIR ON THE REGIONAL BOARD (Section 3, Chapter Chair Resources — regional board overview for chapter chairs):
- Regional board function: Chapter Link — communicate chapter needs to the YPO Global Board of Directors and inform
  chapters of global updates and initiatives; Support — apply regional and global support to chapters; Activities —
  organize activities and initiatives to engage members and chapters; Best Practices — give space for chapters to
  share best practices; Identify Champions — recruit passionate member champions to serve at the chapter, regional
  and global level.
- Regional board structure: the regional board is comprised of elected regional officers serving on the regional
  executive committee (REX) plus chapter chairs from the region. The regional chair leads the regional board.
- The chapter chair's role on the board: Meetings — attend Regional Board Meetings (RBM) to conduct the business of
  the region and share best practices, and attend regional board calls as needed. Vote — vote as a chapter
  representative on regional board matters, and identify a proxy if unavailable for a vote.
Roadmaps for all chapter officer roles are available to download from YPO Connect, and the Chapter Chair Roadmap
PDF can be downloaded from the playbook.

GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS (Section 3): The YPO Policies and Procedures Manual (P&P) and the YPO Operations Manual set
the standards that apply to every chapter; chapter by-laws sit alongside them, tailored to the country of legal
incorporation and reviewed with a locally licensed attorney. The playbook links to the P&P and governance documents
on YPO Connect, and to a downloadable sample chapter by-laws PDF.

SUCCESSION PLANNING (Section 3): Succession planning identifies the next chair, and the chair after that, early —
so leaders arrive prepared, officers have time to train, relationships carry across transitions and chapter strategy
survives a change at the top. It also widens the leadership pool by surfacing quieter champions and giving members a
visible path into service. Chapters are expected to have a succession plan in place by 1 November. The playbook links
to a downloadable Succession Planning Worksheet (maps the leadership ladder three years ahead) and to the Champion
Catalog, an overview of champion positions available across YPO at chapter, regional, global and network level.

STRATEGIC PLANNING / GAME PLAN (Section 3, its own sub-section). Game Plan is simple, memorable, strategic,
engaging and measurable. The methodology was developed in and by the EMEA super-region so every incoming board could
prepare for their year in leadership and governance. Since inception, 140+ sessions have run for chapters, networks and
REX; 38 chapters have repeated sessions and their Chapter Health score rose 13.5% between first and last session; the
average session rating is 4.61 out of 5.
Vision: to elevate the YPO experience for every member, spouse/partner and family in the world. Mission: to empower
boards through strategic planning sessions, helping them prepare and deliver only-in-YPO value.
Session facilitation: sessions are facilitated by certified Game Plan Coaches, who are YPO members with chapter and
regional board experience. Coaches provide facilitation at no charge as their way of giving back; the only cost is the
coach's travel to the meeting location.
Modules: deep dives into specific topics or issues a chapter needs to address, recommended by the coach based on the
chapter's major challenges. Examples: Vision, Values, Learning, Forum, Membership, Member Engagement, Spouse
Engagement, Governance.
Outcomes: alignment on deliverables using data as the foundation; clear comprehension and application of best practices
in how officer roles interconnect; development of SMART goals creating accountability for officers and membership.
Formats: sessions run in 50-minute sprints with 10-minute breaks. 4 hours — one session (a four-hour virtual session is
only for repeat sessions); outcome: Chapter Playbook including SMART goals. 6 hours — two 3-hour sessions on different,
ideally consecutive days for virtual, or one day physical; outcome: Chapter Playbook, SMART goals, and a deep dive into
one module. 8 hours — two 4-hour sessions on different, ideally consecutive days for virtual, or one day physical;
outcome: Chapter Playbook, SMART goals, a deep dive into one module, and completion of the chapter's vision and values.
The playbook links to a "Request your Game Plan" form and a Game Plan video.

CHAPTER SUPPORT PROGRAM (CSP) (Section 3, within Working with your Chapter Manager). The CSP connects chapters with
trained virtual chapter managers (VCMs) who provide short- or long-term operational support to select chapters facing
time-sensitive needs. It ensures continuity, stability and a consistent member experience for chapters in transition
(until a permanent chapter manager is recruited and trained) or assists new chapters during development.
New chapter development support: a VCM provides hands-on operational support during the start-up phase — opening bank
accounts and setting up financial processes and documentation; establishing basic governance, reporting and admin
processes; onboarding and training chapter officers; managing early events and meetings during launch; supporting
recruitment, training and a smooth handover to a permanent chapter manager.
Existing chapter support: VCMs can step in quickly with customized support — covering maternity leave or other planned
absences; bridging gaps after a chapter manager's departure; providing extra capacity during transitions or busy
periods; supporting recruitment, training and handover to a new chapter manager.
How to request support: (1) the chapter submits a support application online or by email to chaptersupportprogram@ypo.org;
(2) chapters are matched with a VCM based on availability, or given a shortlist of VCM profiles; (3) an interview call is
arranged with the VCM candidate(s); (4) after selection, the chapter contracts directly with the VCM, referring to the
sample CM contract. Questions go to chaptersupportprogram@ypo.org.

BUDGET AND FINANCE (Section 3). Setting a chapter budget for a new fiscal year is difficult because it is hard to know
how much to spend in each category. The purpose of a budget is to guide spending for the fiscal year and ensure focus
across all portfolio buckets to maintain a healthy chapter. Available funds depend on renewals and prior-year revenue;
expenses vary by chapter, costs depend on membership size, and costs also depend on the location of events and resources.
Recommended percentage ranges (guidance, not a fixed split — they overlap and are not meant to total 100%):
- Education / Learning: 35%-60%. Have a world-class learning program that helps members learn, connect and grow.
- Family: 10%-15%. Family funding contributes to chapter engagement and stickiness, making a healthier chapter.
- Spouse / Partners: 10%-15%. Inclusiveness makes YPO real for spouses/partners and kids, who receive value themselves.
- Forum: 5%-10%. Forum participation varies; budget based on the chapter's forum goals.
- Membership: 4%-6%. Supports prospective member recruitment events, candidate meetings and referral bonus campaigns.
- Administrative / Employee: 15%-20%. Chapter administrator funding is key to chapter success; CAs range from part-time
  to full-time. Investing in your CA benefits the chapter.
- Operative: 3%-5%. Marketing, postage, bank fees, office, internet and phone.
- Legal / Professional Fees: 3%-5%. Yearly training for officers and chapter administrators; send at least one officer
  to the GLC and CLW; the CA must attend the Chapter Administrator Workshop (CAW) every two years; because the chapter is
  its own legal entity, budget for tax preparation.
A downloadable Chapter Budget Template is available in the playbook.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS FOR CHAPTERS (Section 3). Chapter strategic alliance partners add value by enhancing the chapter
budget and providing learning content and other resources. Best practices:
- Value: think beyond cash — how can the partner provide member value through learning content, resources, venues and
  experiences?
- Connect: touch base regularly to check expectations are being met by both sides and address emerging issues.
- Opportunities: create meaningful opportunities for the partner to meet chapter members. You cannot guarantee new
  customers, but you can position them with opportunities.
- Agreement: work with legal counsel to create a written agreement defining what is expected by both sides.
- Privacy: never share member contact information with a strategic partner, for any reason.
- Code of Conduct: ensure the partner adheres to YPO's Code of Conduct for non-solicitation and confidentiality.
A Sample Chapter Strategic Partnerships Agreement is downloadable from the playbook.

CHAPTER CONDUCT COMMITTEE / OFF-BOARDING (Section 3): YPO policies provide clear guidelines for addressing inappropriate
member conduct so the safe haven of trust is protected for every member. A standing Chapter Conduct Committee gives a
chapter a fair, consistent process to review conduct issues, vet champions, and mitigate risk and liability, rather
than improvising under pressure. Having the committee in place before an issue arises protects the members involved,
the chapter's leadership and the culture. Chapter chairs are strongly encouraged to lead their members through
implementing the recommended steps. The toolkit PDF is downloadable from the playbook.

Off-boarding: the Conduct Committee Toolkit provides guidelines on off-boarding members from a chapter.
The process: (1) Identification — concern identified and documented by the Chapter Manager in consultation with the
Chapter Chair (CC) and/or Chapter Membership Officer (CMO). (2) Chapter Conduct Committee (CCC) review — concern
reviewed against YPO standards, chapter expectations and relevant facts; documentation and context assessed.
(3) Decision point, resolved at CCC level — recommendation agreed upon and documented. (4) Not resolved / complex case
— escalated to the Global Conduct Committee (GCC) for further review and guidance. (5) Closure and documentation —
outcome documented, appropriate records maintained for transparency and consistency.

OFFICER TRAINING (Section 3): Global Leadership Conference (GLC) dates for FY26-27 are GLC Bangkok, Thailand,
15-17 March 2027, and GLC San Diego, USA, 3-5 May 2027. Registration opens in Q2. Virtual sessions will be announced
closer to the time.

WORKING WITH YOUR CHAPTER MANAGER (Section 3): The Chapter Manager (CM) partnership with the chapter executive
committee is crucial to the chapter's success. CMs serve as the chapter operations manager, wearing many hats,
executing daily operations and providing direct support for chapter officers, members and spouse/partners.
Best practices: Give direction — before the chair year begins, discuss chapter priorities and the strategic plan with
your CM, give clear direction on time allocation, and reprioritize together as new projects arise. Set member
expectations — tell officers and members what to expect from the CM, and ensure the CM is not used for non-YPO
requests better handled by a personal assistant. Be connected — meet weekly or bi-weekly, include the CM in ExCo
calls and discussions, and resolve issues before they escalate. Tap their knowledge — CMs hold institutional
knowledge and help identify strategic priorities. Safe haven — in line with the YPO Code of Conduct, provide trust,
respect and confidentiality for your CM. Provide feedback — critical to their development; conduct an annual review
in May or June as the chair year closes. Encourage training — workshops, webinars and ad hoc training keep the CM
current. Contract review — review the CM contract or employment agreement annually in June.
Additional CM resources available in the playbook: Insights on the CM role, CM timeline, CM contract template, and two
CM assessment options.

CONDUCT COMMITTEE (Section 3, Chapter Chair Resources): guiding principle "if it can be solved at the chapter level, solve it."Establish a Chapter Conduct Committee (CCC) annually (recommended five members: current chair, past chair,
membership/engagement officer, two senior board roles). Follow fair process, communicate with the Global
Conduct Committee (GCC), and mitigate risk via bylaws, waivers and D&O insurance. Two-step review: Step 1
initial (Chapter/Network/Global), Step 2 appeal (Global Conduct Committee / GCC Review Panel).
